One of the source of diagnostic information about welding process is sound generated during welding. The sound generated during the welding process includes acoustic audible and inaudible sounds. During the research author focused on analysis ultrasound part of acoustic energy. Acoustic signals used for research purposes were collected during series of experiments conducted in laboratory conditions. Acoustic signals were gather using condenser microphone with measurement range 20-100kHz. The acquired signals were high pass filtered and analyzed using such statistical features as RMS, IQR and Kurtosis in order to detect welding instabilities. The best results obtained for signals in band 20-140kHz estimated with use of IQR parameter. The results of the research confirms usefulness of ultrasound signals for detection of welding faults.},

	abstract = {Concrete production contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, thus a need exists for the development of durable and sustainable concrete with a lower carbon footprint. This can be achieved when cement is partially replaced with another material, such as waste plastic, though normally with a tradeoff in compressive strength. This study discusses progress toward a high/medium strength concrete with a dense, cementitious matrix that contains an irradiated plastic additive, recovering the compressive strength while displacing concrete with waste materials to reduce greenhouse gas generation. Compressive strength tests showed that the addition of high dose (100kGy) irradiated plastic in multiple concretes resulted in increased compressive strength as compared to samples containing regular, non-irradiated plastic. This suggests that irradiating plastic at a high dose is a viable potential solution for regaining some of the strength that is lost when plastic is added to cement paste. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Backscattered Electron Microscopy (BSE), and X-ray microtomography explain the mechanisms for strength retention when using irradiated plastic as a filler for cement paste. By partially replacing Portland cement with a recycled waste plastic, this design may have a potential to contribute to reduced carbon emissions when scaled to the level of mass concrete production.},

	abstract = {The first edition of Sound and Structural Vibration was written in the early 1980s. Since then, two major developments have taken place in the field of vibroacoustics. Powerful computational methods and procedures for the numerical analysis of structural vibration, acoustical fields and acoustical interactions between fluids and structures have been developed and these are now universally employed by researchers, consultants and industrial organisations. Advances in signal processing systems and algorithms, in transducers, and in structural materials and forms of construction, have facilitated the development of practical means of applying active and adaptive control systems to structures for the purposes of reducing or modifying structural vibration and the associated sound radiation and transmission. In this greatly expanded and extensively revised edition, the authors have retained most of the analytically based material that forms the pedagogical content of the first edition, and have expanded it to present the theoretical foundations of modern numerical analysis. Application of the latter is illustrated by examples that have been chosen to complement the analytical approaches to solving fairly simple problems of sound radiation, transmission and fluid-structural coupling that are presented in the first edition. The number of examples of experimental data that relate to the theoretical content, and illustrate important features of vibroacoustic interaction, has been augmented by the inclusion of a selection from the vast amount of material published during the past twenty five years. The final chapter on the active control of sound and vibration has no precursor in the first edition.* Covers theoretical approaches to modeling and analysis* Highly applicable to challenges in industry and academia* For engineering students to use throughout their career},

	abstract = {Welding arc sound signal is an important signal in intelligent welding diagnosis, due to its informative, noncontact, easy collected. However, due to the interference of ambient noise, the arc sound signal is highly complex and noisy, which seriously limits the application of arc sound signals. In this paper, a single-channel blind source separation (BSS) algorithm based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is proposed to purify and denoise the arc sound signals. First, EEMD is used to decompose one channel signal to several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the multidimension IMFs to low-dimension IMFs, which are regarded as the virtual multichannels signals. Finally, independent component analysis (ICA) separates the virtual multichannels signals into target sources. The approach was tested by simulation and experiments. The simulated results show that signals separated from mixed signal using this approach highly match the source signals that make up the mixed signal. Moreover, experimental results indicated that the source signals of arc sound were effectively separated with the environmental noise signals. The statistical characteristics of the spectrum in 5–6.5 kHz band extracted from the arc sound source signals can accurately identify the two types of weld penetrations.},

Based on the developed algorithms in time and frequency domain, multiple feature parameters were successively extracted and selected from sound and voltage signals, while spectrum distribution of argon atoms related to seam penetration were carefully analyzed before feature parameters selection. After the synchronization of heterogeneous feature parameters, the feature-level-based data fusion was conducted by establishing a classiﬁer using support vector machine and 10-fold cross validation. The test results indicate that multisensory-based classiﬁer has higher accuracy i.e., 96.5873 \%, than single sensor-based one in term of recognizing seam defects, like under penetration and burn through from normal penetration.},

The recognition performance of penetration for aluminum alloy in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) still needs to be improved to meet the strict industry demands. This paper proposed a novel recognition method, time-frequency image based convolution neural network (TF-CNN), for GTAW penetration recognition. Time-frequency images were calculated from arc sound signals using short time Fourier transform and applied to analyze the non-stationarity of arc sound. The logarithm of time-frequency image was taken to construct the appropriate input matrix of CNN, which was optimized to improve its recognition performance, including the activation function, learning rate and architecture of network. The experimental results show that the proposed TF-CNN achieved an excellent recognition performance with 98.2\% recognition accuracy and 0.21 accuracy variance for GTAW seam penetration recognition and outperformed the traditional methods. This paper provides some guidance for the application of CNN to other monitoring signals of intelligent manufacturing.},

In this study measurements of acoustic waves generated during GMAW process were performed. Acoustic waves were measured in the surrounding air and in the parts being welded by employing a microphone and PZT sensor. To evaluate inﬂuences on sound generation extensive experiments were performed with two diﬀerent unalloyed carbon steels: DIN RSt13 with 0.1\% C and DIN Ck45 with 0.46\% C, using two types of shielding gas: CO2 and gas mixture by its brand name Crystal (90\% Ar, 10\% CO2) and welding on a slope to vary the distance between welding nozzle and welding part. Acoustic signals were processed to obtain time domain and frequency domain descriptors. Some relationships between descriptors and the weld process characteristics were investigated. Results indicate that the arc sound exhibits distinct characteristics for each welding situation and that the main source of acoustic waves in short circuit metal transfer mode is arc reignition. From acoustic signals one can easily assess process stability and detect welding conditions resulting in weld defects.},

The arc sound signal along with current and voltage signals were acquired and analyzed in time domain as well as in frequency domain. The sound signal kurtosis and arc power were found to be highly correlated with welding process stability. The weld deposition efficiency was also related to weld surface peak temperature. Finally, an attempt was made to correlate the sound time domain as well as frequency domain features of sound signal with the deposition efficiency.

	abstract = {Nondestructive techniques for appraising gas metal arc welding(GMAW) faults plays a very important role in on-line quality controllability and prediction of the GMAW process. On-line welding quality controllability and prediction have several disadvantages such as high cost, low efficiency, complication and greatly being affected by the environment. An enhanced, efficient evaluation technique for evaluating welding faults based on Mahalanobis distance(MD) and normal distribution is presented. In addition, a new piece of equipment, designated the weld quality tester(WQT), is developed based on the proposed evaluation technique. MD is superior to other multidimensional distances such as Euclidean distance because the covariance matrix used for calculating MD takes into account correlations in the data and scaling. The values of MD obtained from welding current and arc voltage are assumed to follow a normal distribution. The normal distribution has two parameters: the mean μ and standard deviation σ of the data. In the proposed evaluation technique used by the WQT, values of MD located in the range from zero to μ+3σ are regarded as “good”. Two experiments which involve changing the flow of shielding gas and smearing paint on the surface of the substrate are conducted in order to verify the sensitivity of the proposed evaluation technique and the feasibility of using WQT. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the WQT for evaluating welding quality. The proposed technique can be applied to implement the on-line welding quality controllability and prediction, which is of great importance to design some novel equipment for weld quality detection.},

In order to achieve goals, bead-on –plate welding was done onto the carbon steel specimen using Metal Inert Gas Welding. At the same moment, the microphone with operating frequency of 31.5 Hz to 8 kHz used to collect air borne acoustic signatures. In analysis part, Empirical Mode Decomposition has been applied to the acoustic signals and the selected Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) was presented in frequency-distance plot using spectrogram. Based on the analysis results, there were 3 significant IMF has been found. Those were IMF mode 3, mode 5 and mode 8 which lie within the frequency of 1500 Hz to 4500 Hz, 200 Hz to 800 Hz, and 40 Hz to 80 Hz respectively. The frequency-distance plot from spectrogram of IMF mode 3 showed a significant pattern which can be related with the discontinuity of welding. The discontinuity appears wherever low amplitude power detected in the frequency-distance plot of IMF mode 3. Moreover, the frequency-distance plot of IMF mode 5 and mode 8 can be significantly related with the spatter and weld pool oscillation condition. High power amplitude in frequency-distance plot of IMF mode 8 can indicates the offset of weld pool oscillation frequency and cause the existence of higher amount of spatter which resulting the high power amplitude in frequency-distance plot of IMF mode 5. In summary, it can be conclude that the application of EMD in the analysis of air borne acoustic signatures allow the detection of several phenomena in welding process which might lead to defect once in a time. This was found to be significant in the process of developing the online welding quality monitoring.},

Theoretical and experimental analyses of the acoustic signals have shown that there are two main noise-generating mechanisms. The rst mechanism generating characteristic sound impulses is arc extinction and arc ignition; the second noise-generating mechanism is the arc itself, which acts as an ionization sound source and produces mainly high-freq uency noise of a low level. The sound signal is used for assessing and monitoring the welding process and for prediction of welding process stability and quality. A new algorithm based on the measured welding current was established for the calculation of emitted sound during the welding process. The algorithm was veri ed for different supply voltages and for different welding materials. The comparisons have shown that the calculated values are in good agreement with measured values of the sound signal.},

	abstract = {In certain domains of production engineering we are faced with very small batch production as it is the case in the production of heavy hydro energy equipment. In this domain manual welding is one of the most time consuming operations. Monitoring of the welding process is essential from the point of work organization as well as from the point of process control. In this paper a novel concept of data acquisition and recording of welding parameters to the welding diary is presented. Several considerations on signal acquisition, sampling rate, processing, data aggregation, wireless information transfer, and presentation are discussed. Implementation of the concept is discussed on laboratory and industrial examples.},

	abstract = {On-line quality control in automated welding operations is an important factor contributing to higher productivity, lower costs and greater reliability of the welded components. However, the development of on-line inspection techniques and feedback control is still in its infancy. Sound signature produced by GMAW contains information about the behavior of the arc column, the molten metal and the metal transfer mode. Manual welders rely on sound signature as important feedback for production of good welds. High-speed data acquisition and computer-aided analysis of the sound signature may indicate conditions that generate weld defects. This paper presents an experimental investigation that attempts to establish correlations between sound signature, welding parameters and weld transfer mode with a view toward detection of weld defects. The results indicate that the sound signature is a usable, practical information source for process-linked quality control of welds.},

CPGFRP/GFRP (carbon powder dispersed in glass-®ber-reinforced plastics/glass®ber-reinforced plastics) composites are superior to CFGFRP (carbon-®ber and glass-®ber-reinforced plastics) composites in respect of their capability of damage monitoring by measuring change in electrical resistance from the early stage of damage, but the former is inferior to the latter as an application because of the diculties of mass production and high cost.

	abstract = {These projects examined the potential for using electrical testing on concrete as a potential surrogate for obtaining information on ion and fluid transport. Electrical measurements are particularly attractive for use in quality control as they are easy to perform, are performed rapidly, and can be directly related to fluid transport. This work describes how electrical resistance measurements should be corrected for geometry to obtain a geometry independent resistivity or conductivity. Further, this work reviews and discusses several factors that influence the resistivity that is measured including porosity, pore connectivity, the role of temperature on degree of hydration (activation energy), temperature effects on conduction, ionic leaching, and the role of temperature and leaching on porosity. The goal of this work is to provide an overview of the main factors that should be considered when conducting electrical property testing, when using electrical properties for quality control/quality assurance, or if using these materials for acceptance. As a part of this project a series of testing devices were purchased and provided to the INDOT district testing labs for the purpose of providing training and providing information on the variability associated with testing. A round robin study has shown that a coefficient of variation of 4.36 \% was obtained leading to a within laboratory precision of 12.8 \% and a multi-laboratory precision of 36.0 \%. This work has shown that temperature can dramatically influence the resistivity. The work has shown that in general for a standard 100 mm x 200 mm test cylinder, the ratio of surface resistivity to uniaxial resistivity, specifically the factor discussed in Section 5.1, is 1.9 for a homogenous material; however if the material is heterogeneous (due to drying or leaching) this value changes. This project has also illustrated the importance of ionic leaching. It was shown that accelerated curing requires temperature correction as well as control of ionic leaching. A direct correlation is discussed between electrical resistivity and the rapid chloride permeability test. At the current time, resistivity tests show promise in a quality control program, as a method of monitoring the variation associated with production. If used in this way, a trial batch could be used to develop target values, similar to that which is currently done with the maturity method. It is anticipated that an agency could eventually have the potential to use resistivity for mixture qualification; however, additional work is needed to correlate the resistivity with performance or service life models.},

Acoustic emission (AE) was used to quantify the extent of damage in the specimens exposed to tensile loading while resonant frequency was used to quantify the extent of damage in the specimens exposed to freezing and thawing. Water absorption was measured in the damaged concrete. The presence of freeze-thaw damage increased both the initial sorptivity and total water absorption. Electrical conductivity was measured and found to increase in a bi-linear fashion with freeze-thaw damage. A knee point in the electrical conductivity versus freeze-thaw damage curve was observed when the dynamic modulus degraded to 75\% of its initial value which appears to correspond with the coalescence of cracking. Mechanical loading was found to only increase water absorption on a local level but it did not substantially influence the overall water absorption.},

The experimental results show that the cracking patterns and deﬂection-load curves of plain mortar and ECC are different when the external load reaches to the ﬁrst-cracking load and ultimate load. The EIS results show that the parameter value of Rct and plural modulus value jZj in fractured mortar increase several hundred times compared with correspondingly origin plain mortar. Moreover, the semi-circle presents in the fractured mortar at high frequency and the diagonal lines are deviated from less than 45 deg at low frequency, and the phase angle (h°) in cracked mortar decreases as the frequency decreases in Bode plots. However, the values of Rct and jZj in cracked ECC increase dozens of times compared to origin ECC, and the phase angle decreases as the frequency decreases. The variation of Rct in Nyquist plots, and the stability and smoothness of Bode plot sensitively reﬂect the cracking degree of cementitious system. In this paper, it is proposed that as a non-destructive method, electrochemical impedance measurement can be used to evaluate the cracking behavior of cement-based materials.},

Based on this model, the trends of the repair rate for different selfhealing times were obtained. The dynamic elastic modulus of all the specimens was tested for verifying the reliability of this model, and the repair rate of the dynamic elastic modulus was calculated according to a similar method. It is found that the repair rate of the dynamic elastic modulus and the damage repair rate were not uniform in value, but with a similar variation trend.

	abstract = {This study proposes a multi-channel electrical impedance-based crack localization technique of fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs) under bending conditions. FRCCs have a self-sensing capability by adding conductive steel fibers into nonconductive cementitious composites, making it possible to measure electrical impedance without sensor installation. Moreover, FRCCs materials can be used as a structural member thanks to its own enhanced structural ductility as well as stiffness. In a structural health monitoring point of view, these characteristics make FRCCs suitable for monitoring structural hot spots, particularly where the crack is most likely to be initiated. Since the electrical impedance obtained from FRCCs is typically sensitive to environmental and operational conditions, false alarms are often triggered. The proposed technique can minimize the false alarms by using currently measured multi-path data as well as localize a crack within the sensing range. To examine the feasibility of crack localization in FRCCs, an instantaneous multi-channel electrical impedance acquisition system and a crack localization algorithm are developed. Subsequently, three-point bending tests are carried out under various temperature conditions. The validation test results reveal that cracks are successfully identiﬁed and localized even under varying temperature conditions.},

This testing methodology is critically evaluated by studying the electrical impedance of an engineered cementitious composite (ECC), using cuboidal specimens with four different dimensions viz. 50 mm, 70 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm. In the present work, the impedance response (in the form of Nyquist plots) of the ECC specimens was measured over the frequency range 1 Hz–10 MHz via two external plate-electrodes placed at opposite faces of each specimen. A conductive gel, or saturated, synthetic sponges inserted between the plate/specimen interface were used as the electrode-specimen contacting medium. It is shown that the sponge contacting medium introduced a spurious response which was detectable across the entire frequency range and was particularly evident in specimens with smaller electrode contact area and in specimens with air-voids present on the contact surface. This eﬀect was considerably reduced when either the conductive gel or sponges saturated with highly-conductive liquid was used. It is also shown that the true bulk resistivity of the material, identiﬁed from the Nyquist plot, can be evaluated by subtracting the resistivity of the sponge itself from the bulk resistivity of the ECC with the sponges present. Benchmarking studies were also undertaken on specimens with an embedded electrode arrangement.},

When presented in Nyquist format, the ECC displayed the typical impedance response comprising a spur at the low-frequency side of the curve and a semi-circular arc at the high-frequency side. It was evident that tensile straining of the dog-bone samples resulted in the entire impedance response being progressively displaced to the right, indicating an overall increase in impedance, and in an increase in the prominence of the bulk arc.
